/**
 * Fabric Router is a top-level router that sits between the root container and the Instance Router
 * that injects the following additional route parameters
 *
 * serviceSlug - The slug of the selected microservice
 * instanceID - The ID of the selected microservice instance of the service with the slug serviceSlug
 *
 * When routes match with a serviceSlug and an instanceID, Fabric Router triggers the async
 * JumpState Effect selectInstance, which clears the metrics store and initiates polling of
 * the metrics endpoint associated with this instance.
 *
 * It also looks up the runtime of the selected microservice and passes it as props to the InstanceRouter
 *
 * @export
 * @returns JSX.Element
