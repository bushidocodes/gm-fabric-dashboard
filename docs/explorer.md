## Explorer

The Explorer is a tool that allows exploration of timeseries data associated
with a particular microservice instance.

Users can:

* Search for timeseries metrics matching a string by entering a string in the
  search field. Results will filter in the selection area below the search field
* Select a timeseries metric to display as a line chart.
* Pan and zoom the timeseries data in the line chart by clicking and dragging
  across a range of time to zoom in and double clicking on the chart to zoom
  out.
* Copy the URL and share with other users with the same access privileges. The
  current selections will open on the other user's screen facilitating discussion
  of a particular metric.
